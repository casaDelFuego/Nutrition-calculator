# Nutrition-calculator
It's an offline calculator for nutritions in the food.

It's a simple calculator made in React Native + Expo. It works offline on a mobile device.
User can add foods that one eats frequently in "Add food" section.
In the primary screen we have a calculator where user can start writing the name of the food and see sugessted options from the existing foods that was added in advance.

After the correct food is in the input, user can add the amount of it (in gramms) and calculate how many gramms of protein, fat or carbs are in this paticular portion of the particular food.

I created this calculator for myself due to my strive to folloee a diet that requres a journal.
It is so simple because I wanted to have a physical journal of food where I write down everything I eat by hand. With pen and paper. 
Having pen and paper in hands prevents me from using my hands to put more food into my mouth=)

I might upgrade this app in the future by adding history and calories count, but for now it's the MVP that I needed to keep my food journal going.
